#**Android Usb Arduino Connection**

##**About**

Very simple Android application for communicating with Arduino MEGA 2560 and other Arduino Boards. 
All you need is a Micro USB OTG to USB Adapter.
This app will only send data to Arduino Board to change the intensity of the internal led present in Arduino MEGA 2560. 
If the user wants to use external pin then they can change the pin number accordingly.



##**Requirements**

- Arduino IDE
- Android Studio
- Android Phone ( Emulator will not work)
- Arduino Board ( Arduino MEGA 2560 preferred)
- Micro USB OTG to USB Adapter
